# Custom partition table for 4MiB flash used by uMatter on C6/C5.
# Goals:
# - increase factory app slot from 0x1F0000 (1984KiB) to 0x280000 (2560KiB)
# - keep NVS/PHY as in MicroPython default
# - keep free flash tail for auto-created "vfs" partition at runtime
#
# Flash layout summary (4MiB):
# - app end: 0x290000
# - free tail for VFS auto-partition: 0x170000 (1472KiB)
